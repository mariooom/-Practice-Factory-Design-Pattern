# Shape Factory Demo - Flutter Project

This Flutter project demonstrates the use of the **Factory Design Pattern** to create objects (shapes) without specifying their concrete classes. The app displays three shapes (Circle, Rectangle, and Square) as cards. When a card is pressed, a SnackBar appears with the shape's name, and clicking the "Reveal" button in the SnackBar prints a message to the console.

## Features
- **Factory Design Pattern**: Centralized object creation using a `ShapeFactory`.
- **Interactive UI**: Three cards representing shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Square).
- **SnackBar Feedback**: Displays the selected shape's name and allows the user to reveal a message.
- **Modular Code**: Separated into logical files for better maintainability.

## App Test
  - Tap on any of the shape cards (Circle, Rectangle, Square).
  - A SnackBar will appear with the shape's name.
  - Click the "Reveal" button in the SnackBar to see the message printed in the console.
